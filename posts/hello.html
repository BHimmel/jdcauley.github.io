<p>I&#39;m a North Carolina native.  My wife and I moved to Greensboro in 2012 hoping to build a better future for our family. </p>
<p>Begining in January 2013 I started taking freelance web development work from a few local digital agencies. Almost 100% WordPress sites at that point I was really a WordPress theme developer.  Since January I have rapidly honed my skills and with a few projects in the spring outside of the WordPress bubble I realized that I was a Front End Developer.</p>
<p>I could figure out how to craft html and html around the elements provided by any CMS or platform that I needed.</p>
<p>In August I started to dive into the tools and power of Node.js with Less, Grunt etc.  </p>
<p>These tools are incredible and I&#39;m now using them every day to increase productivity and make my work just a little easier.</p>
